This code was developed in a Mac OS terminal enviroment.
To run the code, firstly, please compile the code by command "javac Employee.java", and then you can run the code by command "java Employee".

The code is using test data that was wrapped up into a file of "test.csv".

All the methods that were required in the LAB2 assignment were being written and tested in the main function. Please check all the testings in "public static void main(String[] args)"








_______________________________________________________
For a record, all the testings are copied in the following (these are already included in the main function):

	//read data from test.csv test data file
	readfile("test.csv");	
	System.out.println("\n");
	

	//(2)Copy constructor
	System.out.println("(2) Copy constructor");
	System.out.println("Copy Employee no. 6's info into emcopy1");
	Employee emcopy1 = new Employee (em[5]);	
	System.out.println("name copied into emcopy1");
	System.out.println(emcopy1.name);
	System.out.println("Set emcopy1 name to Geferry");
	emcopy1.name="Geferry";
	System.out.println("name of emcopy1");
	System.out.println(emcopy1.name);
	System.out.println("name of Empolyee no.6");
	System.out.println(em[5].name);	
	System.out.println("\n");


	//(3)get and set method
	System.out.println("(3) get and set method");
	System.out.println("Employee no. 1 has name of "+em[0].getName());
	System.out.println("Set Employee no.2 name to Tommy");
	System.out.println("Before set");
	System.out.println(em[0].getName());
	em[2].setName("Tommy");
	System.out.println("After set");
	System.out.println(em[0].getName());
	System.out.println("Employee no. 3 advisor 1 to advisor 9");
	System.out.println("Before set");
	em[2].toString();	
	em[2].setAdvisor(1,9);
	System.out.println("After set");
	em[2].toString();
	System.out.println("\n");
	

	//(4)toString method testing
	System.out.println("(4) toString method");
	em[2].toString();
	em[6].toString();
	System.out.println("\n");
	
	
	//(5)equal method testing
	System.out.println("(5) equal method");
	System.out.println(em[2].equals(em[4]));
	System.out.println(em[2].equals(em[2]));
	System.out.println("\n");
	
	//(6)getAllAdvisors method testing
	System.out.println("(6) getAllAdvisors method");
	System.out.println("In total "+getAllAdvisors(em[0],em[3]).length+" distinct advisors");
	System.out.println("\n");
	System.out.println("In total "+getAllAdvisors(em[3],em[5]).length+" distinct advisors");
